      <p>Our CEO, <strong>Nathaniel Anane</strong>, recently appeared on Univers FM's <em>Talking Business</em> program to discuss how creatives, entrepreneurs, and small businesses can transform "Detty December" into real revenue.</p>

      <h3>What is Detty December?</h3>
      <p>Every December, Ghana comes alive with a month-long celebration known as "Detty December"—a fusion of parties, concerts, beach festivals, and cultural events that attracts thousands of diaspora travelers and tourists from around the world.</p>

      <p>For many businesses, especially in travel and hospitality, this is the most critical revenue period of the year.</p>

      <h3>Key Insights from the Interview</h3>
      <p>During the radio show, Nathaniel broke down strategies for small businesses to capitalize on this festive season:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation is key:</strong> Start planning 3-4 months in advance</li>
        <li><strong>Package your offerings:</strong> Create specific December packages that appeal to both diaspora and local travelers</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage social media:</strong> Build anticipation through strategic content marketing</li>
        <li><strong>Partner smartly:</strong> Collaborate with complementary businesses for bundled experiences</li>
        <li><strong>Deliver excellence:</strong> One great customer experience leads to multiple referrals</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Building Experiences That Go Beyond the Ordinary</h3>
      <p>"At Beyond Borders, we don't just book trips—we create experiences that people remember long after they leave Ghana," Nathaniel shared during the interview. "December is when we get to showcase the best of what our country has to offer."</p>

      <h3>The Conversation Continues</h3>
